import random
'''
Make a list to store 10 words.
Pick a random word from the list and save it somewhere.
Print the length of the random word.
Give players 5 chances to guess the letters in the word while giving them appropriate success and failure messages.
Hint: you can use if i in word - to check if a particular letter is in the word.
On the 6th attempt, ask them to guess the whole word. Compare the randomly selected words with the userâ€™s guess; if it is correct, the user wins.
